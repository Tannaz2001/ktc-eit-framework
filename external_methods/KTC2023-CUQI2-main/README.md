## Description of the algorithm

We have used the provided code for the EIT image reconstruction with the following modification:
- The Otsu segmentation algorithm has been replaced by the Chan-Vese segmentation algorithm from scikit-image.
- Additional generalized Tikhonov regularization has been added to penalize more when close to the missing electrodes (and boundary). The regularization matrix is a diagonal matrix. For example, for difficulty level 5, the added pentaly can be seen in the image below. This regularization adds a penalty to areas of the disk based on the distance to the center, and the angle where elctrodes are removed.

## Installation instructions
To run our EIT image reconstruction algorithm, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- Access to the provided dataset (not included in this repository)

## Examples
|  Phantom 	|  Ref	| Level 1 	| Level 4 	| Level 7 	|
|----------	|-----	|---	|---	|---	|
|**a**| ![](results/01.png)	| ![](results/11.png)	|  ![](results/41.png) 	|   ![](results/71.png)	|   
|**b**| ![](results/02.png)	| ![](results/12.png)	|  ![](results/42.png) 	|   ![](results/72.png)	|
|**c**| ![](results/03.png)	| ![](results/13.png)	|  ![](results/43.png) 	|   ![](results/73.png)	|
|**d**| ![](results/04.png)	| ![](results/14.png)	|  ![](results/44.png) 	|   ![](results/74.png)	|  

Scores for each phantom and difficulty 1,4 and 7:
|   Phantom	| Level 1 	| Level 4 	| Level 7 	|
|-----	|---	|---	|---	|
|**a**|0.749|0.852|0.528|
|**b**|0.918|0.612|0.470|
|**c**|0.934|0.918|0.888|
|**d**|0.750|0.769|0.757|

Scores have been computed using our own implementation of the scoring function based on scikit learn.
